🚀 Cosmic Guess Advanced
Welcome to Cosmic Guess Advanced — the dumbest, funniest, most chaotic number‑guessing game in the galaxy.
You’re not just guessing numbers… you’re burning rocket fuel, dodging meteors, flexing warp drives, and risking a RickRoll if you fail.
Win, and you get +1000 Aura Points because why not. 🌟

🎮 How to Play
- Hit Start Mission to launch your rocket (with a “fahhh” sound if you’re cultured).
- Guess the secret number before your fuel or time runs out.
- Too high? Too low? The game roasts you with cosmic sass.
- Victory = confetti + funny sounds + Aura Points.
- Failure = 💥 explosion + Rick Astley.
